iansasciidoc-preview-frommarkdownpreview_WHAT_WORKS.txt

What does NOT:
 local crossreferences #mytarget
    but do not work in MdPreview
    works in external browser
 code highlighting  -
    code highlighting for code sections within .adoc files to be removed from MDP sections as provided by AD.js
    IMPORTANT: When ctrl-shft-L is used to set grammar to Asciidoc (from language-asciidoc) then when ctrl-shft-P is pressed iansasciidocPreviewFrommarkdownpreview dissapears from the list. So the command ctrl-alt-shft-m no longer exists! source.asciidoc must be added to list: see below.
        Works with grammar tx, html,gfm, Does not work with C, Ruby, Typescript. asciidoc, auto,
    In iansasciidocPreviewFrommarkdownpreview setting under Grammar "source.asciidoc" must be added to default list "source.asciidoc, source.gfm, source.litcoffee, text.html.basic, text.md, text.plain, text.plain.null-grammar" then syntax highlighting takes place in  editor with ctrl-shft-L "asciidoc" enabled. Seems to have to be enabled for each extension with ctrl-shft-L, like asciidoc.txt.  However these are recognised "adoc, asc" ADD TO THIS LIST.  Language-asciidoc README.md says "The default file extensions for AsciiDoc files are ad, asc, adoc, asciidoc, and asciidoc.txt". All of these work except asciidoc.txt which seems to be treated as txt.

What DOES WORK
  Auto update ( if on in setup)
  All attributes set in adoc header like "":toc: left"
  External Links
  keycode for preview toggle ctrl-alt-sift-m  at the moment
  All asciidoctor.js formatting
      Callouts <1> <2> etc
  Convert options & attributes on asciidoctor.convert(text, {...})
  Save html file & copy to clipboard
  ctrl-c  copies selected text in preview which appears in clipboard & can be pasted. Ctrl-a selects all text in preview.



.adoc files not opened on ctrl-ald-shift-m when another asciidoc package is enabled,   but.adoct opens OK. Cantr remember which package   might be ascidoc-preview, or some part of language-adoc.


TEST
  adoc syntax highlight -try ascidoc-preview
  see if syntax highlight from asciidoc-preview or language-asciidoc could be put in asciidoc-previewFromMDP.

  With language-asciidoc enables asciidoc & "asciidoc hack for properties" appears in Edit>Select grammar,ctrl-shft-L list.
    In Select grammar if autodetect or asciidoc is selected them ctrl-alt-shft-m does not open .adoc file. But changing the selection it works at once,

  CHECK link operation of markdown-preview in atomV1.60

  Setting iansasciidocPreviewFrommarkdownpreview to use
